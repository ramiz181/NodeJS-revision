Authentication
    Authentication is the process of verifying identity.
    e.g "Is this user really who they claim to be?"

    What authentication checks:
        - Username + password
        - OTP
        - Token (JWT)
        - Session ID

    When authentication happens
        - At login
        - At every protected request

Example: 
    User says: "I am Ramiz"
    System asks: "Prove it"






server side rendering 

    ==> html document ko server pr load krwana and then send the fully rendered document/html to the client side


Step-by-step:

    1- client sends a request to the server
    2- server generates the HTML (with data/response already filled in)
    3- server sends this complete HTML document back to the client
    4- browser directly displays the page


==>> to do so, we have template engines 
    ==> EJS ==> embedded JS templating
    ==> pug
    ==> handlebars, etc.

export const URL = dbURLConnection.model('URL', urlSchema)


export const dbURLConnection = mongoose.createConnection(
    process.env.MONGO_URI2
);


==>> mongoose.createConnection() returns a connection object and .model() exist on that Connection object
    + mongoose.createConnection don't return any promise 
        so, .then() and .catch won't work like that 
            e.g mongoose.createConnection().then   ==== wrong

            try catch will work incase of -- function 

            e.g - right way :
                    export const dbAuthConnection = async () => {
                        try {
                            await mongoose.createConnection(process.env.MONGO_URI1);
                            console.log("Auth DB connected");
                        } catch (error) {
                            console.error("DB connection failed:", error);
                        }
                    };
            

==>> So, to access .model() we have to use it as object not as a function

==>> And to explicitly log connection/error message we have to use .on() method which triggers on success/failed connection

.
.
.
.
.


==>> .on() is an event listener method
    => when connection will create it will trigger this .on() method 
    
.on(eventName, callback) means:
    -- "When this thing emits this event, run this callback function."
