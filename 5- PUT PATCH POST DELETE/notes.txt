app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

    extended: false ==> supports normal objects
    extended: true ==> supports nested objects
    

express.urlencoded is an express middleware.....it tells express k:
    ==> read the URL encoded form data
    ==> parse it
    ==> attach it to req.body
