server side rendering 
    ==> html document ko server pr load krwana and then send the fully rendered document/html to the client side


Step-by-step:

    1- client sends a request to the server
    2- server generates the HTML (with data/response already filled in)
    3- server sends this complete HTML document back to the client
    4- browser directly displays the page

    ==> EJS ==> embedded JS templating
    ==> pug
    ==> handlebars, etc.
